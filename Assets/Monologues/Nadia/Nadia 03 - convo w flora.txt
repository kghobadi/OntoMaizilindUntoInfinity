Hi Flora-joon! 
We're doing well. 
Ramin-joon is here off-duty for the weekend. 
Yes, the apartment is great. 
We have a view of the mosque from our bedroom. 
Yes, the triplets are staying with us...
At least until Sara finishes primary school. 
Gholam is not working today, thank Allah.
It's been every weekend lately. 
How are Ali and Nader? 
I got the pictures you sent from Cairo! 
The pyramids look beautiful. 
Maybe we can come visit on the new year. 
Has Jahangir been promoted then? 
I wonder if he will get a chance as Prime Minister someday. 
Imagine the harassment from the press! 
Hold on Flora-joon, something is happening.
The emergency alerts are going off. 
I will call you back soon, don't worry.
