Hi Flora-joon! 
We're doing well. 
Ramin-joon is here off-duty for the weekend. 
Yes, the apartment is great. 
We have a view of the mosque from our bedroom. 
Yes, the triplets are staying with us...
At least until Sara finishes primary school. 
She's doing very well, already reading. 
She reads all day and night. 
I think she's not adjusting well to the city. 
Gholam is not working today, thank Allah.
It's been every weekend lately. 
How are Ali and Nader? 
Ali is still such a troublemaker, I see.
Oh, I got the pictures you sent from Cairo! 
Nader's afro is so silly.
The pyramids look beautiful. 
Maybe we can come visit on the new year. 
Has Jahangir been promoted then? 
I wonder if he will get a chance at Prime Minister someday. 
You already dress the part anyway!
When do you think you will come back to Iran?
And if they send you back to the US? 
Another five years is far too much, Flora. 
How can you stand all that traveling?
I can hardly handle leaving the mountains for Tehran. 
Hold on Flora-joon, something is happening.
The emergency alerts are going off. 
I will call you back soon, don't worry.
