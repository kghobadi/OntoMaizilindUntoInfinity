I suspect the word you’re looking for is ‘panic’, or rather a response to uncontrollable sorrow. 
The disappearance of a loved one can do that, you know. 
When somebody disappears, you lose a part of yourself. 
Only you have the power to get that back. 
It can be painful… but I think it’s worth it in the end.
