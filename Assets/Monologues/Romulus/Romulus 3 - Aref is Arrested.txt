Bravo, Cyrus, you’ve brought down another of Ramin’s demons. 
Fighting can be so exhilarating. 
You lust for power in every act, as you despise the fate you’ve been given. 
The cards you were dealt. Everything can be overcome with time. 
You have to remind yourself that only love can heal you. 
The people around you are just trying to help. 
In order to receive it, you need to be willing.
