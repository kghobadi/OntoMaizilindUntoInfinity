My Maman on the left and my Khaleh Flora on the right. They were only 2 years apart and the best of friends. 
They even got married on the same day! Well, week rather. My Maman married my Baba, and Flora married Jahangir Khan. 
Iranian weddings mean entire villages and clans from everywhere comes together.
