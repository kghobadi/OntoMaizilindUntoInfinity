In old photos, my Maman is almost indistinguishable from her sister, Khaleh Flora. 
They have the same smile and eyes. 
Flora was just a little older but they are so similar in so many ways. 
One thing that was different is I know my Khaleh Flora did not want to get married so young.
She did it anyway because everyone convinced her and she because loved Daei Jahangir very much. 
I promised her I will wait to get married until I'm older too.
