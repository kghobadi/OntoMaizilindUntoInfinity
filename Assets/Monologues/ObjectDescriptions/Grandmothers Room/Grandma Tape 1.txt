Ayeshah was born in the 1940s at dawn on the day after a huge earthquake. 
Saideh and Shalah always tell the story as if Ayeshah caused the earthquake and everybody laughs. 
She was just like me in that she had just one eye open. 
She says she lives like that too - one eye in this world and one in the other. 
I wish they would tell me the story of joining Mojahedin-e-Khalq. 
They say I'm too young and that I can't be trusted. 
One day I'll show them I can be a revolutionary too.
