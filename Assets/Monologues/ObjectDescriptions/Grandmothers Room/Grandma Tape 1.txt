Ayeshah was born at dawn on the day after a huge earthquake. 
Saideh and Shalah always tell the story as if Ayeshah caused it.
She had only one eye open and didn't cry. 
In life, she has always been good at seeing the other side. 
She calls it the spirit realm - a place where all our ancestors go when they die.
