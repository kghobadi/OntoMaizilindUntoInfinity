Khaleh Saideh studies Marx and Engels all the time. 
She is always telling me how I don't need to worry about God. 
Saideh never cared as much about ideas
She believes in going to all the people and making sure their needs are met. 
I never went with her to the mines at Zirab, but the workers respect her very much. 
Saideh promises that one day it will all make sense and I will see the importance of socialism. 
I don't argue, but I just don't know what to believe. 
I am just glad that I'm not a mine worker.
