Out of my maman bazoorgs, Saideh was born first. 
She was always treated as the oldest sibling too, which she never complained about. 
She does look the most different, but she is actually a twin. 
To everyone else, they are triplets. They move in unison, speak in unison, and think in unison. 
It means that if one falls, they all do. But if one succeeds, so do the others.
