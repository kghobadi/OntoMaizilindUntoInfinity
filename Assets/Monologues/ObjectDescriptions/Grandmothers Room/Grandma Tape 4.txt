With great love for Islam comes great love for the Ayatollahs. 
My maman bazoorgs are collectors of the Imams speeches. 
These are not allowed, according to my Baba.
I suspect he knows they are here but turns his nose up. 
Maybe he is afraid to talk about them because he does not want to admit that they are right.
