With great love for Islam comes great love for the Ayatollahs. 
My Khalehs are collectors of the Imam's speeches. 
These are not allowed, according to my Baba. 
I suspect he knows they are here but turns his nose up. 
Maybe he is afraid because he does not want to admit they are right. 
I wish they would tell me the story of joining Mojahedin-e-Khalq. 
They say I'm too young to know these things.
One day I'll show them I can be a revolutionary too.
