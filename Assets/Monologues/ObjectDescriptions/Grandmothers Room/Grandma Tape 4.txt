With great love for Islam comes great love for the Ayatollahs. 
My maman bazoorgs are collectors of the Imam's speeches. These are not allowed, according to my Baba. I suspect he knows they are here but turns his nose up. Maybe he is afraid to talk about them because he does not want to admit that they are right. 
I wish they would tell me the story of joining Mojahedin-e-Khalq. They say I'm too young and that I can't be trusted. One day I'll show them I can be a revolutionary too.
