My Khaleh Shalah is most interested in reading about Palestine. 
She is always telling me about new Palestinian leaders and events. 
Shalah describes the actions of Leila Khaled and the PFLP as resistance.
I still have trouble understanding what exactly she means by resistance. 
Shalah promises that one day it will all make sense and I will see the importance of the Palestinian struggle. 
I don't argue, but I just don't know what to believe. 
Shalah says for sure the Iranian nation must learn from the Palestinian people what life is really about. 
She believes they are the bridge between the land of ideas and spirits and the world of action and politics.
