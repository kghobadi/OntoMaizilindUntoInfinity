Shalah was the middle sibling of my maman bazoorgs. 

She always stood between Saideh and Ayeshah as a linkage. Whenever they disagreed, she would manage to resolve their debate by a middle path. 

In life and activism, she did the same - always helping to end conflicts. I know it has made her the enemy of many hateful people.
