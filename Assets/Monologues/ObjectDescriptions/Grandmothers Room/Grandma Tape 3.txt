Shalah was the middle child of my three Khalehs. 
She always stood between Saideh and Ayeshah as a linkage. 
Whenever they disagreed, she would manage to resolve their debate by a middle path. 
In life and activism, she did the same - always helping to end conflicts. 
I know it has made her the enemy of many hateful people.
