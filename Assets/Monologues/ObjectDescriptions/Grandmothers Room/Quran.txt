The Quran is my Khaleh Ayeshah's favorite book. 
She is always trying to get me to read it with them or to them.
Ayeshah describes the revelations as just like water washing over her at "six creek crossing". 
I never had those revelations at shesh rudbar myself. 
Ayeshah promises that one day it will all make sense and I will see the importance of Muhammad. 
I don't argue, but I just don't know what to believe. 
Ayeshah says for sure I will be sent to boarding school if I don't study the holy text. 
In the end, it is an empty threat because my Baba hates Islam.
