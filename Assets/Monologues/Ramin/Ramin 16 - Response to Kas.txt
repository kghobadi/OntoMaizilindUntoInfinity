I know the feeling. It is not easy being away from everyone. 
Listen, you should pursue your dreams. 
You're young and you can do anything you want. 
Don't waste your life on things you don't care about. 
I've accrued so much debt over the years, Kas.
It's inescapable, what I have to pay back. 
Don't end up like me.
