Dear Aref,
I have been trying my best to enjoy my time here in Michigan.
It is difficult being away from the family. 
I've started to have some dark thoughts again. 
I can't seem to muster the energy for my school work either.
Part of me wishes I had stayed. 
I don't want to worry you, but I'm experiencing suicidal ideation again.
Give me a call when you get the chance.
Love, Ramin...
