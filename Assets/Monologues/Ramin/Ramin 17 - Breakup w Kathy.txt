You are getting ahead of yourself. 
Look, there's something I've been meaning to tell you. 
I don't think I can marry you, Kat. 
I just can't do it, I can't stay with you. 
And I wanted to tell you now, before someone else does... 
I already started dating someone else. 
I'm so sorry Kat. I fucked up. But I am doing this to protect you.
Trust me.
